1. Core App (GraphQL API):

This central microservice will expose a GraphQL API that serves as the primary entry point for your application.
It handles user authentication, user profiles, campaigns, collaborations, messages, payments, and reviews.
This service connects to the database and serves as the orchestrator for other microservices.


2. User Service:

This microservice is responsible for user management, registration, login, and profile-related operations.
It communicates with the Core App for authentication and user data retrieval.


3. Campaign Service:

This service manages the creation, retrieval, and update of campaigns.
It communicates with the Core App for campaign-related operations.


4. Collaboration Service:

Focuses on collaboration management, including proposals, contracts, and collaboration status.
It communicates with the Core App for collaboration-related operations.


5. Message Service:

Handles the messaging functionality between users, including sending and receiving messages.
It communicates with the Core App to fetch user details and establish connections.


6. Payment Service:

Responsible for processing payments and managing payment status.
It communicates with the Core App to update collaboration statuses and handle payment processing.


7. Review Service:

Manages user reviews and ratings.
It communicates with the Core App to fetch user and collaboration data for review management.


8. Social Media Integration Service:

For integrating with social media platforms, consider creating a separate microservice.
This service fetches social media data, posts, and engagement metrics.
It can be triggered by events in the Core App when needed for campaigns and influencer profiles.
Infrastructure and Communication:

Deploy each microservice as a separate container in Kubernetes for scalability and isolation.
Use a message broker like RabbitMQ with Redis for persistence to enable asynchronous communication between microservices.
Microservices communicate via message queues for tasks like notifications, updates, and data synchronization.
Implement API gateways or a central GraphQL gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices based on the GraphQL query or mutation.
Benefits:

Scalability: You can scale each microservice independently based on its load.
Maintainability: Isolating functionalities into separate microservices makes it easier to update and maintain specific components.
Resilience: If one microservice experiences issues, it won't necessarily impact the entire application.
Challenges:

Distributed Systems Complexity: Managing a microservices architecture introduces complexities related to deployment, communication, and monitoring.
Data Consistency: You'll need to consider eventual consistency strategies, as data may be distributed across multiple microservices.
Service Discovery and Load Balancing: Implement service discovery and load balancing solutions to manage microservice endpoints dynamically.
Remember that microservices require careful planning and design. It's essential to define clear API contracts, implement proper error handling and logging, and monitor the health of each microservice. Additionally, use tools like Kubernetes, Docker, and service mesh technologies (e.g., Istio) to manage and orchestrate your microservices effectively.
